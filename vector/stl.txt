// In C++, a vector is a dynamic array provided ==> size grow and shrink
// by the Standard Template Library (STL).
// Unlike arrays, vectors can resize themselves
// run time memory allocate == Dynamic memory allocation
// run time polymorphism
// complie time == initially memory jo allocate hogi
// during program execution the memory allocated by the program is called as runtime
// array =  static memory allocation once it is created it cannot be changed
// poly = more than one having same name but with different functionality
// bank = river bank and other one is money bank, blood bank
// area = triangle , sqaure
// marriage how many people will going to come?

// what is array?
// a data structure which is non primitive, which is linear, which is contiguous,
// which hold same data types in linear fashion is called as array, which is having
// concept of complie time polymorphism and once created cannot be modified.

//what is Vectors?
// a data structure which is non primitive, which is linear, which is contiguous,
// which hold same data types in linear fashion having the concept of runtime polymorphism
// which can able to grow and shrink Dynamically

//what is linear datastructure?
// a linear datastructure is a non primitive datastructure which is having the difference
// between two memory location is always fixed and depends on the size of one datastructure

// what is homogenous datastructure?
// where we are grouping the similar datastructure inside one entity

// automatically when elements are added or removed, making them more flexible.

// Key Features of Vectors:
// Dynamic Size: Vectors can grow or shrink as needed.
// Random Access: Elements can be accessed directly using indices.
// Efficient Insertion/Deletion: Insertion and deletion at
// the end of the vector is efficient (amortized O(1)).
